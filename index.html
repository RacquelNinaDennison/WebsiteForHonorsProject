					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</header>
				<p>

					Knowledge representation and reasoning is a branch of Artifical Intelligence which uses logic to
					represent knowledge about the world.
					Automated reasoning methods are used to draw new conclusions from a set of known statements.
					Classical reasoning systems were
					traditionally used to draw conclusions from knowledge bases. Classical reasoning systems are
					monotonic, which means that
					all information is certain and adding new information will not retract conclusions previously drawn.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, Perry the Platypus once used a classical reasoning system. While spending time with
					Phineas,
					Perry learned that mammals give birth to live young. Given that they are a platypus and that
					platypuses are mammals,
					Perry logically deduced that platypuses must give birth to live young as well. However, Ferb later
					informed
					Perry that platypuses actually lay eggs. This contradiction confused Perry, as their reasoning
					system was
					not flexible enough to accommodate the new information. Perry's dilemma illustrates a key weakness
					of classical
					reasoning: it struggles to handle exceptions or conflicting data.
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/perry-baby.png" /></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Defeasible (non-monotonic) reasoning systems accomidates exceptional knowledge allowing Perry to say "mammals typically give birth
					to live young".
					When Perry concludes that "platypus do not give birth to live young", the system would retract its
					previous conclusion
					that "platypus do give birth to live young". Perry would still exist if they used a "common sense"
					approach to reasoning.
					
					The aim of this project was to encode this common sense reasoning using Answer Set Programming (ASP). We focused on computing 
					reasoning systems defined by the KLM framework.

				<!-- Propositional Logic -->
				<header id="prop" class="major">
					<h3>Propositional Logic</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Propositional Logic uses symbols to represent basic
					statements about the world that are assigned a value of true or false. Boolean operators are used to
					combine these
					statements to form more complex statements.
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/prop-operators.png" /></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, Perry would use the symbols p, m and ly to represent platypus, mammals and liveyoung, respectively. Perry
					then combines
					these symbols using boolean operators to make the statements "mammals have liveyoung", "platypus are
					mammals" and
					"platypus do not have liveyoung".
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/perry-classical.png" /></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Truth tables can be used to define the meaning of each boolean operator. And, those meanings are
					used
					to reason about propositional statements. Common questions asked are "What statements can we
					conclude to be
					true given the information known?". This is known as classical entailment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/perry-exist.png" /></span>
					Using truth tables (or more efficient semantic tableau methods), Perry can logically conclude
					that
					"platypus can give birth to liveyoung". But, Perry already knows that "platypus do not give birth to
					liveyoung" and it is impossible for both
					of these statements to be true. So, Perry does not exist. To solve this, Perry explored defeasible
					reasoning which minimcs common sense reasoning.
				</p>

				<!-- The KLM Approach -->
				<header id="klm" class="major">
					<h3>The KLM Approach</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					The KLM approach, proposed by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor, is a well known approach to defeasible
					reasoning. It allows us to represent statements such as "mammals typically give birth to liveyoung"
					using a defeasible
					implication operator. Statements which use the defeasible operator as known as defeasible
					statements.
				</p>

				<span class="image fit-ish"><img src="images/mammals-tyically .png" /></span>

				<p>
					If Perry tries to conclude that a new defeasible statement is true based on previous statements,
					classical
					and defeasible, they can use defeasible entailment to determine the answer.
				</p>

				<span class="image fit-ish"><img src="images/knowledge-base.png" /></span>

				<p>
					Defeasible entailment has been defined by multiple defeasible entailment relations in the KLM
					framework.
					The entailment relation focused on in this project is Rational Closure.
				</p>


				<!-- Rational Closure -->
				<header id="rc" class="major">
					<h3>Rational Closure</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/perry-surprised-2.png" width="200%" /></span>

					Rational Closure is a defeasible entailment formalism within the KLM framework, designed for
					reasoning with exceptions. It
					organises knowledge hierarchically, allowing more specific statements to override general ones.
				</p>

				<p>
					The reasoning process involves two main steps. First, the statements in a knowledge base are ranked
					by exceptionality — how specific
					or exceptional they are relative to others. More exceptional statements are assigned higher ranks.
					This step is defined by an algorithm
					called "Base Rank", whose purpose is to rank knowledge bases.
				</p>

				<span class="image right"><img src="images/rc-ranked-removed.png" /></span>

				<p>
					The second step happens when querying the knowledge base (e.g., about platypuses), where general
					statements at lower ranks are progressively filtered out, leaving
					only the most relevant, specific information. This ensures that exceptions are handled effectively,
					allowing conclusions to reflect
					both general rules and exceptional cases. This step is defined by an algorithm called "Rational
					Closure", whose purpose is to perform defeasible
					entailment checks over the ranked knowledge base.
				</p>
				<!-- Answer Set Programming -->
				<header id="asp" class="major">
					<h3>Answer Set Programming</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					A programming paradigm is a style of programming that defines the structure and elements of a
					program. There are many
					different programming paradigms, each with its own set of rules and conventions. Most programming
					languages are based on
					the imperative programming paradigm, which explicitly defined the steps taken to arrive at a result. While the declarative 
					paradigm defines what solutions of a problem should look like and not the steps taken to solve a problem. 
					
				</p>	
					
				<p>
					Below are some contrasting features of the imperative programming paradigm and the declarative programming paradigm:
				</p>

				<span class="image fit-ish"><img src="images/declarative-vs-imperative.png" /></span>

				<p>
					Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm that uses logic to represent
					knowledge and solve problems.
					ASP programs are written in a logic-based language and are used to represent a set of rules and
					facts. The rules are used to
					define the problem and the facts are used to define the initial state of the problem. The ASP solver
					then uses these rules and
					facts to find solutions to the problem. Rules in ASP are of the following form:
				</p>
				<span class="image fit-ish"><img src="images/asp-rules.png" /></span>
				<p>
					Example: Perry can take all the facts about platypus and mammals and represent it using the following ASP rules:

					<h2>
						ASP Definition of Rational Closure
					</h2>
					<h3>Jack Mabotja</h3>
				</header>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>
					This part of the project is motivated by the observation that while Rational Closure has been
					implemented
					in various imperative programming languages, there has been limited exploration of alternative
					implementation
					approaches. This gap in research presents an opportunity to investigate whether different
					programming paradigms
					might offer improved performance or other benefits. Our choice of ASP is driven by the hypothesis
					that its
					declarative nature might be particularly well-suited to the logical structures inherent in Rational
					Closure.
					ASP is known for its ability to separate the logic of algorithms from their control mechanisms, a
					feature that
					can potentially enhances programmer efficiency and code clarity.
				</p>
				<p>
					We used two approaches to implement Rational Closure in ASP. The first
					approach was defined after the first approach was tested and its limitations
					were identified.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<h3>
						<li>Search-based Approach</li>
					</h3>
					<P>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/perry-searching.png" /></span>
						In this approach, Rational Closure is treated like a search problem.
						The procedure is defined below:
					<ul>
						<li>We start by defining the characteristics of the target solution we seek.</li>
						<li>We then enumerate the whole search space.</li>
						<li>We search through the search space to find our target.</li>
						<li>After identifying the solution, we then return it.</li>
					</ul>
					</P>

					<P>
						The benchmark results of the search-based approach illuminated two bottlenecks of the approach:
					<ul>
						<li>The search space size increases exponentially, making the implementation harder to scale.
						</li>
						<li>
							In most cases, there are multiple solutions that satisfy the characteristics of our target
							solution,
							requiring optimisation to find the most optimal solution.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</P>
					<h3>
						<li>Recursive Approach</li>
					</h3>
					<p>
						In this approach, Rational Closure is restated recursively.
						This approach eliminates both bottlenecks in the search-based approach.
					</p>
				</ol>

				<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>
					The two implementation approaches were benchmarked against an existing imperative
					implementation of Rational Closure. Only Base Rank was benchmarked. The results are shown below:

					<h3>Note!</h3>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li> Racquel also created a search-based implementation of Rational Closure in ASP.</li>
						<li> I created two search-based implementations of Rational Closure.</li>
						<li>
							In the second graph,
							I plotted the performance of Racquel’s encoding against the
							defeasible statement count in isolation to clearly demonstrate its
							behaviour.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Key Findings:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> The runtimes of the search-based implementation increase exponentially with the statement
						count.</li>
					<li> The runtimes of all the search-based BaseRank encodings change with the increase in the rank
						count, but the
						change is largely influenced by the statement count.</li>
					<li>
						The recursive approach is the most ideal way to implement Rational Closure in ASP.

									<h2>Knowledge Base Generator</h2>
								</header>
								<h3>Racquel Dennison</h3>
								</header>
								<p>One of the aims was to define a set of rules that generate knowledge bases for testing our ASP definition of Rational Closure. A parameterised knowledge base was defined which allowed for generating knowledge bases with different features, such as:</p>
								<ul>
									
									<li>Allowing users to specify how many defeasible statements they would like in the knowledge bases.</li>
									<li>Allowing users to specify how many defeasible ranks they would like in the knowledge bases.</li>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/perry-grr.png"/></span>
									<li>Alowing users to specify how the statements should be distributed among the ranks. Three distributions were defined:
										<ul>
											<li>Uniform: Statements are distributed evenly among ranks.</li>
											<li>Random: A random assignment of the number of statements per rank.</li>
											<li>Linear: The number of statements per rank grows linearly.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Allowing for the generation of knowledge bases with the inclusion of classical statements.</li>
									<li>Allowing for the generation of knowlege bases with encoded classical statements as defeasible statements.</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								For example, given the ranked knowledge base:
								
								<span class="image fit-ish"><img src="images/knowledge-base-gen.png" /></span>
								<p>In our generator, the following is obtained:</p>
								<pre><code>defeasible(a(2),l0) defeasible(a(2),a(4)) defeasible(a(2),a(7)) defeasible(a(2),a(1))</code></pre>
								<pre><code>defeasible(a(1),a(5)) defeasible(a(1),a(0)) defeasible(a(1),-l0)</code></pre>
								<pre><code>defeasible(a(0),a(5)) defeasible(a(0),a(9)) defeasible(a(0),l0)</code></pre>
							<br> 
							The format of statements produces are of the right format expected as input in our definition of Rational Closure. 
						The knowledge base generator was tested on its generation time. We explored different solver
					configurations offered by clasp when running experiments.

					<h2>Rational Closure interpreter</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					To facilitate the use of Rational Closure in ASP, we developed the <strong>Rational Closure Interpreter (RCI)</strong>, 
					a user-friendly graphical user interface that allows users to interact with the reasoner 
					without needing to learn about the ASP language, offering a more intuitive and accessible experience.
					Furthermore, the RCI provides an explanation service of how the Rational Closure algorithm
					works, and how the conclusions are drawn.
				</p>

				<p>The Rational Closure Interpreter is developed in the PyQt framework, a Python library that
					provides a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework.
					In its architecture, RCI adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and employs a 
					multi-tier structure, resulting in a modular and scalable design.
					For the backend, the RCI uses the ASP implementation of Rational Closure, developed by Racqual Dennison.
				</p>

				<p></p>
				
				<h3>
					Main Features of the Rational Closure Interpreter:
				</h3>
				<p> 
					The Rational Closure Interpreter provides users with 2 main services:
				</p>
				<h4>
					Entailment Checker
				</h4>
				<p>
					This service allows users to check if a defeasible query is entailed by a knowledge base.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Input, upload, or generate a knowledge base.</li>
					<li>Enter a defeasible query.</li>
					<li>Determine if the defeasible query is entailed by the knowledge base.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>
					Process Visualisation
				</h4>
				<p>
					This service allows users to visualise the process of how the entailment result was reached, providing explanations.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Step through the process of how the entailment result was reached.</li>
					<li>Highlight the formulas that directly and indirectly influence the entailment of the query.</li>
				</ul>

				<span class="image rci"><img src="images/RCI-interface.png" /></span>
